## Description

This project allows users to create a payment-gated folder where they can upload photos, decide a price in USDC, and a receiver Solana wallet address. Their folder will have a unique link they can share.

Users will have to pay to be able to access the folder with the content (files / photos).

This project includes an edit page that users can pay to access. The page features curated prompts where users can upload their photos (such as ones they’ve just purchased access to) and style them to their liking. This saves time and provides users with the option to have specific event photos edited in styles they prefer.
